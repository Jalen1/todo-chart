The model and core business logic of this application was built using Java. Spring Boot was leveraged to locally host the application on a web browser, and to abstract
boilerplate utilizing built-in annotations. PostgreSQL was utilized on the data layer to collect data outputted from the application, and 
Postman was used to test Get, Put, Post, and Delete requests on application endpoints.
